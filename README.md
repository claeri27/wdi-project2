The link to my surge is here: [Movie Grabber](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Movie Grabber

The purpose of this site is to find and display movie data easily. Users can choose to see a list of movies and then filter the list according to what they want to see. There will be a search bar as well as 'Popular' and 'Now Playing' buttons. The list of movies will not display until the user presses a button.

## Potential Issues & Solutions:

Getting the API to return the movie poster images may be difficult. I'll solve this by getting help from teachers or researching google. I plan on implementing a lot of high quality css when I'm done so that will probably be the hardest part.
